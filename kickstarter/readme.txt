This scrapes Kickstarter to get information on successful video game projects.  It also scrapes mobygames.com to get a list of video game titles.  See kickstarter/nonspider/final_report.py for more information on gathered and analyzed information.

Change kickstarter/settings.py as required, then use ./run.py to control scraping and analysis.
